Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed) 3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front. 4. No pouch provided. 5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.',\n",

       " \"I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones. PROS: 1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement. Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones. Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp. Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment. 2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed. 3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs. 4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that. 5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too. 6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment. 7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear. 8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind. 9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG. CONS: 1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough. 2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup. 3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it. Final words: Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly. Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms). Thank you for reading. Cheers!!!\",\n",

Here is some key information about the product: 1.It can connect with 2 device at same time.I connect with my phone and laptop which is very benifitial for me, I attain meeting and online classes on laptop and in between any phone call comes on my mobile it automatical switches towords call and after the call back to my lappy. when i play video on both phone or laptop it automatical switch towords whereever video is playing. 2.support fast charging(only in the \"PRO\" modle). 3.Audio quality is best. 4. light weight.',\n",
       " 'First of all the Pros:  1. Bass - I have used tons of Bluetooth earphones from brands like OnePlus (Wireless Z & Z Bass Version), Boat (TWS, Rockerz 335), Boult Audio (TWS) and Truke (TWS) including neckband and TWS types. But, none of them had Bass as good as the ones on the 255 Pro+. I have never before in my life listened to any wired/wireless earphone which gave bass as good as the ones on 255 Pro+.  2. Battery - Company claims 40 hrs playback time on a single charge when listened at 50% volume (device volume). Even many YouTube reviewers have done reviews and said the battery life came close to 32-34 hrs at he max. Even another Youtuber said battery life will come around the 26-27 hrs mark (of course i never believed him). But Boy, I tested the music playback time on these on my secondary device. Kept the phone volume to 40% and the earphone volume to around 50% mark and I got a loud, bassy and enjoyable soundstage while achieving a battery life of a ROCKSOLID 47 hrs 52 mins before I started getting the \"Battery Low\" voice prompt every 1 min. At this stage the battery was at 20%. Close to 48 hrs against the company claim of 40 hrs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not sure why the company underplayed the numbers here XD.  3. Sound Quality - At the price point of Rs 1,500, don\\'t expect quality to be as good as Sony, Bose or Apple. But what i got was decent instrument separation, above average overall clarity, excellent bass (forget other options at any other/given price point). I am going to use these as my daily driver to accompany with my Oppo Reno 10x Zoom which lacks a 3.5mm jack.  4. Built Quality - Many reviewers here on Amazon and Youtube cited the cheap built quality. Trust me once you experience the above 3 Pros, built quality aspect will become negligible. Also, I personally felt these very comfortable over the neck. At times I even forgot it was there.  5. IPX7 rating - This is awesome at this price point.  Cons:  Human beings are greedy creatures. The way the battery life was performing, I was expecting to reach 50 hrs of music playback time xD. But come on, getting 8 hrs on top of the company claimed 40 hrs is in itself INSANE!!! Few reviewers complained of a hissing sound. I never got one (neither while listening during the day time or night time).  Bottom Line:  I am planning to get another one if this one fails in the next 1 year. Am sure if taken care properly, these will last atleast for a good 2-3 years. Better buy these before gets out of stock. Going to do a review on YouTube soon.',\n",

I tried it on 3 different phones, with three different UI's. All the phone's supported Aptx. These earphones automatically connect to either AAC or SBC. 2. Not comfortable for long hours as the earphones doesn't fit well. The earplugs feels cheap. 3. Strange hissing sound in the background when not in use. Hardly noticeable, as it goes after 45-50secs, but it's there and can be annoying. 4. Magnetic lock is useless as it does not switch off or disconnect calls. Its just there.

While driving on high altitude windy areas, the sound clarity is still clear and that makes me give it a thumbs up.  3. The battery life lasts for almost 3 days and thats quite reasonable for me  Cons: -------  1. Though there aren't many cons but yes the noise cancellation is quite less when compared to many other earphones  2. Quality checks need to be taken care of since we had to get one of our earphones exchanged due to connectivity issue  Overall it is a great value for money for earphones. Do pick it up,\",\n",

As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel 3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd. 4. Noise cancellation is good. 5. Ear comfort is ok.  If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.

Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon\\'s insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.  Pros: 1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating \"You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255\" 2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time 3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok 4. Music is so good to listen while driving.  Cons: 1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it\\'s my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song. 2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side. 3.

The microphone is the worst. The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap. Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.

It\\'s very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don\\'t know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don\\'t know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it\\'s really frustrating, trust me.  *Experience:* The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says \"Oops, battery low\". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience. Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.  *Sound Quality:* The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it\\'s not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.  *Build Quality:* Build quality is really good. No issues with that.  *Battery life* Satisfied with battery life.

Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you\\'ll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the connection gets lost. Moreover , since it\\'s a Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that.

Only problem is that it\\'s earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too.

It has a nice thump feel. 2- Fast charging. Gets fully charged in less than one hour. 3- Earpieces are magnetic attached to each other. This gives a good grip around the neck. 4- Wire is dust and sweat proof. 5- Battery can last upto 10 hrs if used only for calls. Cons: 1- On continuous music usage, battery lasted for around 6-7 hrs. 2- Bluetooth auto-disconnect feature not present when the buds are stick together. This does impact the battery performance.

       " 'I’ve been using this for past few months now.  At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.  Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.  1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.  2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.  3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.  4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.  5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.  6. Poor Battery level indicator: if the battery level is full, then you’d be rest assured that you’ll have battery power for 2-3 hrs. If the level is less than full e.g 80-90%, you can expect battery to run out in around 2 hrs. So, the battery level indicator is not true indicator of actual battery level. Which means, you always keep it 100% charged if you don’t wanna risk running out of battery.',\n",

Battery is way too powerful than sony, both standby and playback. After proper testing it last almost 35 to 40hour on normal volume. Havent tested on high volume. Where as sony Hps priced at 2500 and above last only 15hrs on normal volume. TYPE C charging point which is better than b4. 6. One imp thing earlier boat headphones did not show how much battery % is left this show 20% 40% 60% so you know when u habe to charge the headphone. On 40% it will last upto 8hours. 6. Microphone does pickup background sounds but some noise cancelling Hps dont even pick up speech. I dint find any issue with this. 7.

What I liked: 1. It's light and comfortable to wear. 2. Sounds are clear while on call or playing videos. 3. Can stay connected and alternate between two devices at a time, so I don't have to repeat the pairing process between my laptop and phone.  What I did not like: 1. I got the ocean blue one which looked shiny and bright in the product ad, but the colour is actually a dull matte light blue. 2. Bluetooth range is less than 10 metres 3. Active playback time is only 6 hours after 1.5 hours of charging. 4. The ear guide is not comfortable for long periods, but the earphones also keep falling out of the ear when guides are removed. 5. Looks cheap. Plastic buttons have rough edges and wires are not smooth. 6. Wires are too long, hanging all the way to the tummy when not in use. There is no provision to adjust cord length.\",\n",

       " 'Day 2 (Aug 12th 2019) I watched videos and listen to few songs. It did not hurt in ear. My purpose of buying them was for calls only. I do find them good. I checked with few people through Skype as well. It was good. It did last for more than 6 hours. When I received it was 100% charged. I started using it. Today the only challenge I saw was it was not connecting with my Bluetooth when it was left with 20% battery. I put it on charge. It recharged within the time of 1 hour or so.  Date : August 17, 2019 - I am not music freak but the quality and sound is good for music. I majorly use it for my long day calls through Skype. In starting it was good, there were no issues. After few days I started facing connectivity issues. On 15th I was watching something or other whole day. I noticed that till the time I was using it the battery % was 100. I took a break and reconnected it was like 80%. This was the percentage after a regular play time of approx 3 hrs. Suddenly it started giving audio message ,oops and all that . The battery was showing 20% and it turned off at 20% battery. This was little upsetting for me. I requested for a replacement so I will be getting it on Aug 20, 2019.  In this 1 year I have used 5 Bluetooth earphones. iBall, U8i, Samsung Muffspro and boAT. To give them a rank it will like this (Best at 5) 1. Samsung 2. iBall 3. Muffspro 4. U8i And the winner among them is boAT.  This review is completely after using these mentioned headphones for more than 4 hour each day. The review is based on Battery,Sound Quality, Ease of talking on phone, Ear comfort. All these products were under 3000 INR. The best part about boAT is quality, durability and battery.

I have a 50 Mbps wifi, I'm using this earphones with realme X2 pro which has bluetooth 5.. and just head on YouTube stream anything select quality to 720p or above and video will smoothly but audio will buffer so much.

Usually i buy a electronic product after thorough research on the specifications, product reviews, price etc. BUT WE TOO NEED TO WEIGH THE AFTER SALES SERVICE. I had a problem of charging my earphones after 10 months of use within the stipulated warranty period of 1 year. Next I tried their Customer Care number but there is no online or on phone registration facility of the complaint! They send a sms link to register but the link doesn’t open (see pictures)!! Next I sought their service centre in my city Ahmedabad and found a single centre for the whole city some 10-11kms away. I reached the centre to be totally disappointed with the centre which was a small shop size with no parking. They checked and found the problem to be due to water damage to the charging point. Even though never has my earphones touched water, I accepted that and asked for the solution, but then the twist started! They refused to repair it even on payment basis - reason that they were just there to replace the piece if it was a manufacturer defect. They genuinely were not their for any repair work. They asked me to talk with the call centre executive to find the repair solution but the call could not be connected to the executive in spite of 20mins of waiting. I am trying to talk with the company for last 48 hours but every time the recorded voice assures me that My call is going to be connected in short time but no success. In short I feel that I will have to ditch the 1100/- rs product for just unable to get a customer paid repair. The thing I disliked is that in today’s smart world the boat customer website is not taking an online or telephonic complaint and you can not talk to the executive.

       " \"I bought this Bluetooth earphones in August 2020 for my wife. I already have Boat Rockerz 255 (Old Model) which I have been using since 2019. My observations are as below. Rockerz 255 Pro are not as reliable as Rockerz 255. It's Battery life is pathetic and most of the time, if the battery percentage is around 40 %, earphones may start also.  Many a times, We have to put them for charging to start the earphones.  Last but not the least, built quality of these earphones is not as sturdy as older model. I am not sure whether battery of my earphones has got swollen within one year itself but my battery compartment has become so loose now that upper cover falls down and battery gets exposed with a slight jerk while jogging. Thinking of using my Warranty to get them replaced for Manufacturing issues with Battery and design.\",\n",
       " \"Hey Amazon read carefully, I will give it only 1 star after using 10 months because there is worst customer service ever by boat rockerz company. I had 1 year replacement warranty but they were not giving me answer properly for replacing my faulty unit. Worst service and you Amazon selling worst units like this. Worst service. Really I become very annoyed in replacing this product. Also my prime subscription going to over of Amazon that I'm not renewing now. Clear message. Help and support customers or ready to suffer.\",\n",
       " 'Writing this review after 1 week of use. I ordered this during lockdown period and Amazon delivered it on time with proper packing. Coming to the Rockerz 255 Pro headphone, this really work as it suppose to. I have all my Laptop and mobile having BT v 4.x and this this BT v5 headphone work perfectly. It will connect to the device immediately you switch it on. I use this for all my Teams and skype calls from office (WFH) along with mobile call during office time and this works perfectly. simultaneously it can connect with with one laptop and one mobile. Battery backup is also sufficient. really good purchase at this price range.',\n",

       " \"I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones. PROS: 1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement. Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones. Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp. Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment. 2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed. 3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs. 4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that. 5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too. 6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment. 7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear. 8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind. 9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG. CONS: 1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough. 2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup. 3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it. Final words: Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly. Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms). Thank you for reading. Cheers!!!\",\n",

While gaming little bit or minor delays in video & Audio but when watching videos on youtube or other video platforms on smartphone i didn't notice any delays. Also comfortable in my testing when using continuously 6 hours. Dual pairing worked. IPX7 water certification is good i tested it properly no issues.

And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.  Regards SIDDHARTH\",\n",

       " 'First of all the Pros:  1. Bass - I have used tons of Bluetooth earphones from brands like OnePlus (Wireless Z & Z Bass Version), Boat (TWS, Rockerz 335), Boult Audio (TWS) and Truke (TWS) including neckband and TWS types. But, none of them had Bass as good as the ones on the 255 Pro+. I have never before in my life listened to any wired/wireless earphone which gave bass as good as the ones on 255 Pro+.  2. Battery - Company claims 40 hrs playback time on a single charge when listened at 50% volume (device volume). Even many YouTube reviewers have done reviews and said the battery life came close to 32-34 hrs at he max. Even another Youtuber said battery life will come around the 26-27 hrs mark (of course i never believed him). But Boy, I tested the music playback time on these on my secondary device. Kept the phone volume to 40% and the earphone volume to around 50% mark and I got a loud, bassy and enjoyable soundstage while achieving a battery life of a ROCKSOLID 47 hrs 52 mins before I started getting the \"Battery Low\" voice prompt every 1 min. At this stage the battery was at 20%. Close to 48 hrs against the company claim of 40 hrs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not sure why the company underplayed the numbers here XD.  3. Sound Quality - At the price point of Rs 1,500, don\\'t expect quality to be as good as Sony, Bose or Apple. But what i got was decent instrument separation, above average overall clarity, excellent bass (forget other options at any other/given price point). I am going to use these as my daily driver to accompany with my Oppo Reno 10x Zoom which lacks a 3.5mm jack.  4. Built Quality - Many reviewers here on Amazon and Youtube cited the cheap built quality. Trust me once you experience the above 3 Pros, built quality aspect will become negligible. Also, I personally felt these very comfortable over the neck. At times I even forgot it was there.  5. IPX7 rating - This is awesome at this price point.  Cons:  Human beings are greedy creatures. The way the battery life was performing, I was expecting to reach 50 hrs of music playback time xD. But come on, getting 8 hrs on top of the company claimed 40 hrs is in itself INSANE!!! Few reviewers complained of a hissing sound. I never got one (neither while listening during the day time or night time).  Bottom Line:  I am planning to get another one if this one fails in the next 1 year. Am sure if taken care properly, these will last atleast for a good 2-3 years. Better buy these before gets out of stock. Going to do a review on YouTube soon.',\n",

Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating \"You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255\" 2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time 3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok 4.

The microphone is the worst. The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap. Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.

They did not had any replacement available in stock so registered a complaint. Complaint status showed that the pickup request will be generated in 1 business day. Nothing happened even after 2 days. I needed a replacement urgently as I was working without any headphones so I called customer care again. I got a standard reply that you will get the resolution in the next 48 hours. Nothing moved. I again called them after 3 days ( 7 days since my complaint was registered). The executive on the other side said that the issue will be resolved in the next 72 hours. I kept on telling her that I am without headphones and if I don't get the resolution immediately then I will be forced to buy a new headset and that would not be just. I was appalled by the unprofessionalism of an executive on-call. She was totally unaware of the actual problem on why replacement is getting delayed and despite my request refused to even come back on it or provide any assistance of any sort except 72 hours rant. @boat If the warranty of the product has not been honored even after a week then it's the same as not giving a warranty at all.

       " 'I don\\'t usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.  *Reliability:* The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don\\'t use it for like 3-4 hours. It\\'s very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don\\'t know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don\\'t know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it\\'s really frustrating, trust me.  *Experience:* The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says \"Oops, battery low\". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience. Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.  *Sound Quality:* The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it\\'s not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.  *Build Quality:* Build quality is really good. No issues with that.  *Battery life* Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn\\'t last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.',\n",

Kindly don't bother paying attention to the negative comments which are without pith or substance. These have exceptionally good battery backup and sound quality especially bass. The sound quality improves amazingly with the usage. Call quality and Bluetooth connectivity is superb!! However, built quality of the neackband isn't as per my liking as I like heavy duty and sturdiness. Be as it may, the built quality is good. I would definitely recommend buying these.\",\n",
       " \"The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.\",\n",

I earlier had connectivity issues between Lenovo devices and boat, none this time. Noise cancellation - decent. Fit - the earbuds aren't the most comfortable but shouldn't be any pain with moderate use. Also, it is unlikely to fall off with fast walk or jogging. However, the neckabamd seems flimsy. What I didn't like - I have never been a fan of neckband style earphones. And these looked ill fitted. The neckband and the wires are bigger than required. I didn't use it for the ill fitting so would have to cut the review short.\",\n",

Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you\\'ll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the connection gets lost. Moreover , since it\\'s a Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it\\'s still running very strong though i don\\'t use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it\\'s earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don\\'t bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There\\'s no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.

       " 'Overall, a steal at this price range. It has that thumping bass factor which is missing these days in most of the midrange earphones. I have used both Realme wireless buds as well as this Boat Rockers 255 pro. Here is the comparison: Pros: 1- For a bass lover like me, this earphone is better than the Realme buds. It has a nice thump feel. 2- Fast charging. Gets fully charged in less than one hour. 3- Earpieces are magnetic attached to each other. This gives a good grip around the neck. 4- Wire is dust and sweat proof. 5- Battery can last upto 10 hrs if used only for calls. Cons: 1- On continuous music usage, battery lasted for around 6-7 hrs. 2- Bluetooth auto-disconnect feature not present when the buds are stick together. This does impact the battery performance. Realme takes the advantage here. 3- No USB-C support. No big deal.',\n",

       " 'I’ve been using this for past few months now.  At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.  Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.  1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.  2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.  3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.  4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.  5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.  6. Poor Battery level indicator: if the battery level is full, then you’d be rest assured that you’ll have battery power for 2-3 hrs. If the level is less than full e.g 80-90%, you can expect battery to run out in around 2 hrs. So, the battery level indicator is not true indicator of actual battery level. Which means, you always keep it 100% charged if you don’t wanna risk running out of battery.',\n",

Mic: Disappoint You. If you want to talk to someone, the other person will hear all the noises around you. Believe me. Even thought your far away from TV. It was capture it. This product doesn't have Noise Cancelling.  Pair: You can pair it to 2 devices at a time. Battery: 4 hours continuous for music and movie.  If you just want to listen music. Just go for this. Not recommended for phone calls.  Finally, Hit YES if you like the review. Thanks\",\n",
       " 'Day 2 (Aug 12th 2019) I watched videos and listen to few songs. It did not hurt in ear. My purpose of buying them was for calls only. I do find them good. I checked with few people through Skype as well. It was good. It did last for more than 6 hours. When I received it was 100% charged. I started using it. Today the only challenge I saw was it was not connecting with my Bluetooth when it was left with 20% battery. I put it on charge. It recharged within the time of 1 hour or so.  Date : August 17, 2019 - I am not music freak but the quality and sound is good for music. I majorly use it for my long day calls through Skype. In starting it was good, there were no issues. After few days I started facing connectivity issues. On 15th I was watching something or other whole day. I noticed that till the time I was using it the battery % was 100. I took a break and reconnected it was like 80%. This was the percentage after a regular play time of approx 3 hrs. Suddenly it started giving audio message ,oops and all that . The battery was showing 20% and it turned off at 20% battery. This was little upsetting for me. I requested for a replacement so I will be getting it on Aug 20, 2019.  In this 1 year I have used 5 Bluetooth earphones. iBall, U8i, Samsung Muffspro and boAT. To give them a rank it will like this (Best at 5) 1. Samsung 2. iBall 3. Muffspro 4. U8i And the winner among them is boAT.  This review is completely after using these mentioned headphones for more than 4 hour each day. The review is based on Battery,Sound Quality, Ease of talking on phone, Ear comfort. All these products were under 3000 INR. The best part about boAT is quality, durability and battery. I might be buying an upgrade device of it soon.',\n",

When there was a problem with the product, we are to register our complaint as per method indicated in policy terms since more than a month now, but could not register till date. Instead of complaint being registered, each time a phone number popped up, which is surprisingly NON OPERATIONAL. We could not even talk their customercare number as it had an indefinite waiting time . Thereafter we tried to get in touch with them through Instagram, facebook and twitter, but to our surprise they just did not respond even then. Each time they simply asked for our number but never reverted back. It seems that they are simply waiting for the warranty to expire so that they can thereafter be free from the obligation of honouring the warranty. Pathetic after sales service.',\n",
       " 'This is genuine feedback after buying this crap. I have Boat wired earphones and I am pretty happy but this one I purchased after going by so many positive reviews, unfortunately, its a crap!! Immediately asking for return!! Pros: Music and base is very good, base lovers\\' paradise.  Cons: 1. Fitting is worst, loose and if you jog or run it will be very uncomfortable and move along with you 2. Range is pathetically low, I had pTron which without any hype was much better in range. I think instead of 10m its max \"10 feet\"!! 3. Call quality is pathetic and I feel mic is worst, even roadside 100 bucks earphone will have a better mic. If you occasionally want to call with this, just forget this crap!! 4. Noise cancellation, CVC etc are marketing scams and nothing good for this CVC especially in little noisy areas!! 5. Battery backup is knowingly very low, carry the charger along!! 6. Material is cheap and poor, except the flat wire 7. charging port cover is pathetic and will not last more, on top due to low battery it will be used heavily!!',\n",

       " 'It is probably one of the worst bluetooth headphones available in the market. and this i am saying based on my personal experience. Apart from Bluetooth connectivity & Bass Quality issues, one of the major defect is that it is not at all sweat proof as being advertised. & since it is not sweat proof it stops working abruptly anytime in between workout & becomes dead for an extended period of time plus in my case speaker functionality completely stopped working within the first 2 months of purchase.  I would strongly recommend not to buy this product if you are looking for a decent sports bluetooth headphones.',\n",

For voice call for initial few second(around 40sec to 1 min) the voice is distorted and the other party is not able to hear you, and in between also this problem occurs randomly. 2. They claim connectivity with 2 device simultaneously , but it get disconnected in between. 3. Sound quality is normal I have used \"Boult Audio ProBass\" and i can say that sound quality of Boult is more aggressive specially with bass. 4. Seriously not worth spending 1600. 5. Build quality is good. 6. Want refund for this product.',\n",
       " \"EDIT, After using it for 2 weeks I'll say you honestly what I witness, 1- Sound is not that much, earphone is not that loud.. you'll find a normal wired earphone many times louder. 2- If you're using it to listen music, bass to be precise.. this is not for you, because this has very low bass compared to basshead 152,182,102 or any other good wired earphones. 3- it's ideal for receiving calls and stuff, but I don't think wireless earphones looks good. 4- I have been using it for 2 weeks and the problem I face is that if you use this earphones over watching High quality videos.. video will play properly but audio will buffer so much like we're steaming a video on 2g net. I have a 50 Mbps wifi, I'm using this earphones with realme X2 pro which has bluetooth 5.. and just head on YouTube stream anything select quality to 720p or above and video will smoothly but audio will buffer so much. So I brought my all earphones, selected quality of video to 1080p and used all earphones and my one wireless ptron earphone everything worked fine just I connected this with my phone, audio started lagging. At one time this earphone was connected to only my phone and my phone was only connected to this earphones but still idk what's the issue.\",\n",
       " 'First impression: Just unpacked and pairing was very easy. I was able to pair this to my OnePlus 5T and Laptop. After pairing my phone first, I switched off the bluetooh in phone and paired with my PC. Then switched on the bluetooth in phone. Played music from PC and when I received a call in my phone, the headset goes silent and the music automatically pauses. Exactly the way I wanted. However, one drawback is that when the phone call ends, the music doesnt resume automatically.  Sound Quality is good - Good bass - Comfortable to wear  Suggestion for the manufacturer: As soon as the device is paired, not sure why the voice says \"You plugged into Nirvana\"? And instead of referring the connected device name, the headphone voice says \"You are connected to Boat Rockerz\".. Shouldnt this be the name of the connected device..(Mobile name or the laptop name)?',\n",

Just using for hearing music & watching movies. Replacement process is good, they only come and collect your product and return using courier, if you raise ticket online.

And that too, only work for like 10-15 days, after that left side of ear piece stopped working totally! That's right! Within one minth of purchasing, this issue has happened. My only mistake is that, instead of returning it to amazon, I've sent it yo replace under warranty to the company. And the company took 30 days!! To replace it under warranty! And even the replaced earphone stopped working on left side within a week! This is just waste of money, and it's a chinese manufactured product, so obviously a waste of time and energy.  I'll neither purchase it nor recommend it to any one. Save your money and buy some wired earphone instead else go for some good company as I've purchased 2 of these and both started creating problem one after other.\",\n",
       " 'I usually don’t write a review but felt the urge to mention the very unprofessional after sales service support so as to affect purchasing decisions. Usually i buy a electronic product after thorough research on the specifications, product reviews, price etc. BUT WE TOO NEED TO WEIGH THE AFTER SALES SERVICE. I had a problem of charging my earphones after 10 months of use within the stipulated warranty period of 1 year. Next I tried their Customer Care number but there is no online or on phone registration facility of the complaint! They send a sms link to register but the link doesn’t open (see pictures)!! Next I sought their service centre in my city Ahmedabad and found a single centre for the whole city some 10-11kms away. I reached the centre to be totally disappointed with the centre which was a small shop size with no parking. They checked and found the problem to be due to water damage to the charging point. Even though never has my earphones touched water, I accepted that and asked for the solution, but then the twist started! They refused to repair it even on payment basis - reason that they were just there to replace the piece if it was a manufacturer defect. They genuinely were not their for any repair work. They asked me to talk with the call centre executive to find the repair solution but the call could not be connected to the executive in spite of 20mins of waiting. I am trying to talk with the company for last 48 hours but every time the recorded voice assures me that My call is going to be connected in short time but no success. In short I feel that I will have to ditch the 1100/- rs product for just unable to get a customer paid repair. The thing I disliked is that in today’s smart world the boat customer website is not taking an online or telephonic complaint and you can not talk to the executive. VERDICT: I will definitely avoid BOAT products in future in spite of attractive Branding and cheap prices due to a very lazy service system.',\n",

Cons : poor battery , don't last even more than 2 hours , noise cancellation isnt powerful, that earcuff is very painful ,u can't keep it more than few hours and it falls off everytime.  I had to exchange once I purchased and to the worst I had to give it to SERVICING CENTRE OF BOAT after 15 days of re-exchange purchase one .

Rockerz 255 Pro are not as reliable as Rockerz 255. It's Battery life is pathetic and most of the time, if the battery percentage is around 40 %, earphones may start also.  Many a times, We have to put them for charging to start the earphones.  Last but not the least, built quality of these earphones is not as sturdy as older model. I am not sure whether battery of my earphones has got swollen within one year itself but my battery compartment has become so loose now that upper cover falls down and battery gets exposed with a slight jerk while jogging. Thinking of using my Warranty to get them replaced for Manufacturing issues with Battery and design.\",\n",

The rubber cap which fits the charging socket will break and render the headphone with no protection from sweat or water. There is no active noise cancellation. Outside sound will get damped only if the EarPods fit in your ear properly In summary: do not buy if you need great sound quality, and do not buy just looking at the number of people who have reviewed the headphones. I did that and I find my money wasted The only good part- ear fitting is good and it comes in a variety of colours.',\n",

Sound quality is good but the problem is, it didnt lasted more than a year and left bud just died. It usually happens boat products lasts around a year or so, but this one lasting 8 months was a surprising.  Read warranty information, and this should be covered in warranty. Created a ticket on their support website. Received ticket number and email mentioning the pickup process proving the return shipment details and the waybill number. Problem is, it never got pickup up since a week. Here is the ordeal  - You would receive a message for couple of days intimating pickup and executive number. Executive never comes for pickup. When trying to reach on his number, it says incoming is disabled on this number. SMS cannot be sent on this number. Overall you can never reach on this number. - When you email the courier company, you would receive standard email that it will be taken care or responded back within 24 to 48 hours but nobody cares to respond back - When you call the courier company number it never accepts the AWB or your mobile number - When you try to email Boat Support, again standard response to follow support website for complaint. Now, the website has only two options to create complaint or to check status. - When you call boat support, option 1119 will take to customer care execute. I doubt if any real person exists to take your call as it always keeps you on hold for 2 minutes and says all executives busy and we will reach you later and sooner but nobody ever calls. - You just have to follow madly but you cannot reach anyone here.  All together, BoAt products sound good at consumer level but lack quality and now I think they are designed that way, not to survive for long, so you keep buying new ones every year. A desi chinese product company. The support is nothing but sham. A product which doesnt build to survive for long enough isnt a good choice, and I would recommend to buy something better with your hard earned money.

Sound quality - As i am a bass lover, I have satisfied with the sound stage of this device. Lows and mids are clear with an adequate amount of bass. 2). Build quality - Build quality of the product is exceptionally great for this price and it has two magnets which holds the ear pieces in place. 3). Sweat proof - Suitable for gym freaks. It can easily withstand the splashes and sweat since it has IP rating. 4). Battery life - This product can last for 6 to 8 hours depending on your usage. Charging time takes around 45 minutes to reach 100%  CONS: 1). Connectivity - Bluetooth range is not that great. After moving 5 meters away from the device, the connectivity gets lost. So, mostly make sure that you carry your mobile along with you and the battery information about the device is not appropriate. Some times it shows 80% in my device and all of a sudden it indicates 20% battery remaining. 2). Tactility - Buttons on this headphones are not that easy to press. It needs some hard presses which sometimes feel irritated.  So, if you are a good bass lover and looking for a good wireless earphones at an affordable price then this should be your choice probably.',\n",

And this is not great because listing to full volume for a long time can damage your ears.  4. Charging It does support the fast charging. You can enjoy your Neckband again after 1.5hours of full charging.  5.cVc technology This technology is used for making clear voice calls while you are in a crowded area. It works pretty well but if the noices are too much it wouldn't help you either.  6. Sound quality Music I'm getting over it good. Thumping bass is not available but yes good overall. Treble level is good so the vocals and high frequencies can be listen greatly. Don't expect same sound quality in traffic area as noise isolation is not great that much.  Overall it is a good product and that's why rated 3 starts.  Hope it will help you 😇 Cheers!\",\n",
       " 'Pros: charge time 2 hrs and backup is very good full day use (6 hr continuous) two led colors red and blue . while using blue light blinks after every few secs, in-build ringtone (trrrin trrrin type). using in honor 6x show battery icon in 100-80-50-25-0 stages.Gives warning on low battery and when connected or disconnected (human voice).

       " \"I'm writing this review after using these earphones for quite sometime. I don't use earphones regularly and I keep them very safe. First of all, it stopped working all of a sudden in like 4 months, it neither started on clicking the power button nor charged up. Secondly, the battery time was horrible, even after full charge it barely worked for 3 hours. Regarding the sound, it was average just like any other earphone so I was sort of okay with it, though noise cancellation did not work. (Bass was a bit better) Even the customer service is quite frustrating and I couldn't get my replace till now even after so many days of complaint.  Overall I would say it's an overhyped product, price wise okay but then it's better to invest in a quality product than just changing it often.\",\n",
       " \"I wanted a set of Bluetooth headphones that I can use at work, as well as while exercising. I have found it to be quite decent.  Pros: * Can connect to 2 devices at the same time. * The ear bud provide good sound isolation, and reduce background noise to a large extent. * The microphone is quite good, and none of the people I spoke on the phone with, could recognize that I was on a heaset. * The earbuds don't come out, no matter how much I shake my head, or move around. (Important while exercising) * They are light and comfortable enough to wear while sleeping, and having your head on the side.  Cons: * If you wear it while running/jogging, the neckband keeps jumping. Would have loved some magnetic clasp on the neck which would prevent it from jumping out. * When the battery is down, it just gives a warning and shuts down; Would have loved it, if it could have a warning at say 20%, so that you can decide what to do after that.\",\n",

Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.',\n",

Within 10 mins, your mind goes from music to 'whats pocking in my ears'. Overall, a bad experience.

       " \"I am writing this review after using it for 1 week.  1) Battery Backup: For battery backup I would say it is the best earphone in its class. I charged it only once on the day of received and didn't charge. I am using it more than 1 week continuesoly, 5-6 hours daily in music and phone conversation and it has still 60% battery. I would highly recommend it for long lasting battery backup.  2) Charging Time: It took 1 hour to get complete charge and as per my usage experience, it seems true that if you charge it for 10 monutes it would give 10 hours battery backup. It has type C charging port and type C cable in the box.  3) Call clarity: It is giving optimum performance while talking. It supress almost 70-80% background noice while you talking means the other person can hear your voice very clearly and you can hear him/her very clear.  4) Cotrols and Mic position: It has 3 control buttons. Its Mic is built in within the the wire in cotrol panel which makes it more near to your mouth. Which grasp very clear voice while talking.  5) Comfort: It is very light weight and very comfortable to wear within ears and around your neck. You can easily wear it while running or in work out or commuting.  6) Water resistant: It has IPX7 certificate which means you do not need to worry about water splash or sweat.  7) Sound quality: It has 10 mm sound driver. It is modified to give optimum bass quality for music. I am loving while listening songs or waching movies. Superb sound and bass quality.  Conclusion: But it and stay tension free. You will love this product.\",\n",

Despite the claims, AptX is NOT SUPPORTED (Tried on both Snapdragon and Exynos devices), though AAC is good enough. 2. Very poor build quality, and unergonomic design. 3. Slow response from buttons, it takes at least 1 second for commands to get executed. 4. No auto-pause/play or on/off functionality when attaching the buds using magnets. Also, magnet quality is flimsy. 5. Multi-device connection supported, but cannot switch between devices. It will only play from the device that was connected first. Only way to switch devices is to disconnect the first one, which essentially renders this feature useless. 6. As many people have pointed out, a continuous hissing sound is present when nothing is being played. It's not that noticeable, but it shouldn't have been there.  Overall, not a bad pair of earphones, but adding a few hundred rupees and going for oppo/oneplus would be better value for money.\",\n",

So, returned them and received a new one and they stopped working as well within its first month. Sound quality was just average, the effort for the brand it seems is just to make profits and nothing else. Any advice I can give is start making products after trying and proper testing. If you have the numbers for selling to why not make products exciting.

To be honest, wrt sound quality, this Boat one is far behind all of them except MI basic & Byte Corseca where it's equivalent.  The reason being, you can't get everything at such a low price point. If you want good quality in-ear wireless experience to be ready to shell out more.  Every product category has a minimum price value required for impressive performance. Below that value, compromises need to be made.  P.S. Battery backup is not an issue owing to the form factor. It's comparable to BH 505 and ranges around 5-6 hours.

Filters out a good degree of ambient noise. Charging port compatible with standard Android USB mini smartphone charger cables  CONS: Not very comfortable to wear. The band is hard and hangs down putting strain on your ears. Will be especially painful to wear during exercise. Not sure why they couldn't design this section as ordinary wire. Poor battery life.

On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-) 3. can use it when wearing a helmet. 4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured. 5. Neck design if u like it. 6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.  Cons: 1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this. 2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help. 3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.  I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.

       " 'October 5, 2020: First impressions  ► The device did not power on; made me think it might have been shipped without any charge in its battery. I charged it for ten minutes and was then able to power it on. Once connected to my phone, it said the battery was at 80%. That was a bit confusing.  ► I played → soft piano music → ghazals → old and recent Bollywood songs → techno, pop, and jazz → debates and mushaira. The device performs quite well. The bass is good as advertised, music and voice are clear. I am satisfied.  ► I have not yet tried voice calls with the device. I don\\'t spend much time on phone calls, so the call quality does not matter to me much.  ►Looks and build are OK.  ► Earbuds are soft and well-fitting. However, that does not mean they will feel comfortable for everyone. The same is true with all wearable devices.  ►THE ONLY THING I HATE SO FAR: The annoying pre-recorded message you hear in a loud male voice upon powering on, connecting and power off the device. Quite annoying. Check out what it says:  When you power on the earphones: \"Power on! You have plugged into Nirvana. Your device is ready to pair.\"  When you connect to a phone or laptop: \"You\\'re now connected to Rocerz 255 Pro!  When you post off: \"Adios, amigo! Powering off.\"  Trust me, you will feel irritated listening to all that every time.  Before buying BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro, I considered One Plus Bullets Z, Realme Buds, Lenovo HE15, and Boult Audio ProBass. I verified the accuracy of reviews for all these devices and checked for the possible deception involved. I found that the reviews for BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro were much more reliable.

Verdict: If you want a good Bluetooth headphone, spend some more money and get a better one. Or stick to wired earphones in this price bracket. To get a decent quality wireless earphones, you have to spend Rs 4k-5k at least. The problem is not with Boat but every companies who sells Bluetooth earphones at this price point.

The person at opposite end will hear a lot of ambient noise, even the slightest movement at your end will become annoying for him.  Basically it will pick up niose even if you turn your neck or the headphone brushes with your collar.  Would have loved it if the voice within was that of an Indian.

The port for charging is covered with a rubber based plug, which is surprisingly durable despite not looking as much.  Sound quality is good, Bass is okay. Noise cancellation pretty much the same as most other in-ear models.  It is a good buy, value for your money.',\n",

The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.

Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.  2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.  3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.  4.

Cons:- It irritates when you listening music on full volume, sound doesn't get distorted but it irritates on full volume,so it will be better if you keep its volume below 80%.

I bought the ear phones mainly coz I had to take my evening walks on my terrace due to covid and hence, i wanted wireless earphones tht work while moving within a given radius which is far less than the stipulated 10m distance. on tht count, I found the earphones disappointing. When u r on the move, the sound quality suffers even if u were kind of close to ur phone. Not totally bad but I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise when idle and sitting at one place, sound quality is quite good. Battery n other functionalities work just fine. Fits well.\",\n",

Earphones got little wet on several occasions and still worked absolutely fine. -Battery life is also really good. I had to charge them once in 2-3 days because i used them a lot on daily basis.

Cons -------  1) biggest con is huss sound or buzz sound at low volume. It is so annoying. I am quite surprised why reviewers have not said anything about this. If you want to listen to songs or calls at low volume. This is not the best, ready to get bothered by consistent hissing sound.  2)if you like to run or jog while listening to songs, this one is definitely not for you, since the movement of band will cause lot of noise disturbance while running and will annoy you. Its ok if you want to just sit and listen. 3) I don't find the fitting very comfortable, it seem claustrophobic to be. Ears started to pain after 30 minutes or so. Boat needs to work on design of earpiece to make it more comfortable.  4)sound quality is not as Supreme as marketed in reviews etc. The lows are very poor. Bass comes to effect after mid ranges. Overall not a very soothing experience in terms of listening.  Pros ------  Build quality is good. Wires look string and premium and buttons looks of good quality plastic. 2)bluetooth range is good, no issues encountered while moving from one room to another. 3)there is a battery symbol displayed on phone, so you get to know the charge level.  Overall summary For me the first con of huss and buzz sound is enough to not recommend you to go for it, I have not tried any other bluetooth headset so can't say which one is best. GO ahead for if you can bear with the same and only listen to music at very high volume.\",\n",
       " \"Wrote a much longer review but the page reset so I am not re-typing- The bass was good (bass lovers might enjoy it..) but a bit too high/heavy for my liking and so it tends to drown out/reduce the clarity of other instruments and the vocals at times too. Similar to the MDR and XB Sony ranges as far as the bass and overall output goes. The battery life is decent at about 6 hours listening at 70-80% + of the max volume. The wireless range was also decent and can be put at approximately 15 feet max - but with say two walls in between (so it might be a little more minus the walls..). The magnetic lock seems to work just fine, have not really tested the microphone much- the widened neckband is great and gives the earphones stability on the neck. My main issue came down to the life span of the product- I thought the build quality and durability was above average but then this happened- Bought this a few months ago but I left it pretty much sealed and untouched in its box (I continued to use my Apple and Skullcandy wired earphones-the sound quality on the Apple pods is still brilliant so I still use the wired ones over wireless earphones whenever possible/not too inconvenient) - so I only started to use the Boat earphones a month or two ago and well- the left earpiece is already malfunctioning and had almost stopped outputting any audible sound on a few occasions now. I did tend to use the earphones at 80% plus of the max volume but if that is the cause for failure then the earphones obviously are not engineered as well as claimed. Now the volume of the left earpiece is softer and less clear than the right- and has faded away completely on occasions that I have tried to listen to music for a stretch of about 4 hours on 80% volume or such- I am just trying to keep the volume low at the moment so that the earpiece does not stop emitting sound completely again- will have no choice but to get in touch with their customer service if the issue persists and see what they say- but the only conclusion I can draw from my experience thus far is that these earphones lack even say Skullcandy's durability which at least use to last almost a year even when used for long stretches of time at about 80-90% of the upper volume limit for music etc.\",\n",

       " \"Purchased boAt Rockerz 255 in October 2019. Within 5 months of usage, the right ear piece started putting out lower volume than the left ear piece. Thankfully it was still in warranty so got it exchanged in June of 2020. Today is 23 July 2021 and the new replacement also is having the same issue. The right earpiece output volume is very low, exact same problem as the last one. The unbalanced volume causes irritation especially when watching movies or listening to music.  This is actually a very common complaint with boAt Rockerz 255 and their other wireless products. If you google it, you will find 1000's of people like me who have just blown Rs1000/- for a product that doesn't even last a year properly. The annoying thing is I cannot even get my money back or exchange these.  Pros: 1. Fits in-ear properly 2. Good bass and volume. 3. Decent range. More than 10 Meters in line of sight. Catches my Bluetooth signal from my phone even when in the other room. 4. Decent design with attractive colours.  Cons: 1. Completely unreliable product and boAt Rockerz 255 hasn't even made an effort to correct their mistakes. I am now left with Rs1000/- junk which is hardly one year old. 2. Microphone is extremely sensitive. Caller hears all the background noise to a point I have had to disconnect the headset just to save some headache for the caller. There are times where I had to turn off the fan because the air from the fan was creating enough noise to irritate the caller. 3. Battery Low warning to unit completely shutting down is way too less. It gives hardly 5 min warning before shutting down. 4. Battery doesn't last more than 5 hrs at full volume. Might last the promised 8hr but that would be at 50% volume. 5. The charger port cover is flimsy that it breaks in the first couple of months. Happend to both the headsets.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this product till boAt Rockerz rectifies the issues, recalls all the faulty headsets and either replaces them or repairs them.

However 'Rockerz' branding is missing which is not big deal.  Previously i have used sony, nokia, skullcandyand JBL bluetooth headphones, so its difficult for me to lower down with boat. If you want to listen music then its good option. Little Bass is present.  Controller buttons plastic plate length is little extra compare to other headphones. LED indicator is tiny and not continously available. Additional rubber curve above earbuds are good for little additional grip. Considering lower price in segment, this product is okay. If budget is your priority or if its your first try with Bluetooth then blindly go for this. It will not put you down. Cheers, Ashutosh\",\n",

It disconnects even if the phone is in my pocket and I’m wearing the earphones. Bluetooth is buggy and will constantly disconnect Talking handsfree is a hassle. Bluetooth handover is not smooth Poor bass At loud volumes, the sound is distorted.  I’ve used these earphones for a year now and it’s honestly not worth it. For the same price range there are other earphones that are way better. The sound and bass issues are less of a problem than Bluetooth connectivity. They’re wireless earphones. Without Bluetooth connectivity it’s useless. Looks like they tried to cut corners in the wrong areas.',\n",

There may be delays in sound when you pause and play a video. Happens rarely. 4. Causes tinnitus. . Better to use it for watching movies and sometimes music.\",\n",
       " \"Before stating it's pros and cons, I would like to say that I've used Sennheiser Cx180 before this which just broke down after satisfactory use of more than 2 yrs. So I'll be comparing sound quality of this with that.  *Pros* → Lightweight → Superb sound quality → Attractive & durable design → Good Battery life → Google assistant/Siri → Tangle free wire with magnetic heads → Sweat proof  *Cons* → Though Bass is awesome, you can find a bit compromise in mids & high, but you won't be able to notice this unless you compare it with some high end headphones. → Slight pain in ear if you wear it for long.  *Overall verdict* 9/10 Just go for it if you want Bluetooth headphones for ₹1.5k, you are not getting any better than this.  [ EDIT: After using about 7 months one side of earphone stopped working. So I raised a ticket for warranty and also they were able to pickup my product, but unfortunately due to corona they could not replace it as their service centers were closed. I've sent them almost 7-8 mails which were not replied and many calls which were not answered and if somehow they answered 1-2 calls they didn't solved my problem. Now it has already been 3 months and everything is normal after lockdown still my headphones are stuck with them. Finally I have lost hope from this useless company and their incompetent service and I am looking for some genuine brands this time.]\",\n",
       " \"To the point, PROS: 1. The sound quality is good. The bass is sometimes too much, clarity is compromised. But most of the times, it does pretty good job. 2. Pairing and range is superb. Upto 5 meters even 6 it does not cut if no obstacles. Comes handy in gym where i move away from the phone. 3. Ansering calls/speaking is very convenient, and because of the band the mouth piece is at the right position for calls.  CONS: 1. The band is a nuisance in gym when you're running, doing pushups etc, it keeps falling away. Cannot secure it tightly during workouts. Wearing on the head is temporarily okay. 2. The fitting of the ear piece is not correct. With the same sized ear tips my other earphones fit very snugly. This one keeps falling off my ears. 3. Although the sound quality is good, the clarity is not great if you're concerned about crisp music. The sound is loud and bass is good, but the clarity of music is average.  Finally, for this price, This is the best on Amazon.\",\n",

Build Quality ~ Very good. It's very lightweight, but doesn't seem to be fragile. (4.5/5)  2. Sound Quality ~ Absolutely brilliant. I had seen many YouTube reviewers claiming that the Bass is this overpowers all the tiny sounds, but that's compeletely wrong. (4.5/5)  3. Bass + Treble ~ The balance is quite fine, and if your music player has an equalizer you can tweak the balance according to your liking. (4.5/5)  4. Comfort ~ These are lightweight as I have already mentioned, so it is a given that they are comfortable, even when using for hours. But personally, I have found that the left ear hook doesn’t fit as comfortably as the right one. You can remove the ear hooks though! (4/5).  5. Battery backup ~ For me it has been more than 4.5 hours. (4/5)  6. Pairing ~ As easy as it gets. (5/5)  7. Noise Cancellation ~ Great.

Asking a customer to travel all the way to some service centre (spending Rs +500 for a Rs 899 item) in the city to get the product examined (esp at a time when COVID is all around) is preposterous and reeks of customer apathy.

       " \"I was so amazed for as to get this one. I acquired a same day delivery. The build quality is top notch, it feels rugged and strong; the wires and the earpiece felt wonderful. Yet, the thing I'd like to regret is it is not as light as the Boult wireless headphones. This is a bit heavy. I specifically bought it for gym as I have three JBL for home and office purposes. So in gym, while on a workout, you can definitely feel the a light weight on your ears.  Also, I feel that the wires should be length adjustable as in a Boult headphone. I feel the wires are a bit lengthy. But, this definitely is a better choice than Boult. I compared it with my friends Boult headphones. This one was the best in sound quality, build quality and all.  Secondly, the noise cancellation is absurd. Not upto the mark, not even as good as other earphones of this price. But the other qualities like sound, strength, battery, Bluetooth connectivity, all rocks in this headphones. To this price range, this is wonderful.\",\n",

I claimed warranty & they took my old one & reolaced it with new one. boAt after serviced is very good, I'm impressed. They came to my home & took the defective product & replaced it with new one.

Wearing along with the ear guides may irritate you but again at the same time it helps to hold it in ear. * Voice of calls were clear & loud to other end but you feel some annoying sounds. * No auto on-off with magnetic bud, this feature can help to improve the battery life.',\n",

       " \"Date: 17/12/2019 - Magnetic back stick to each other while hanging from neck. I usually hang the earphone crossed i.e. left in the right and right to the left and while wearing, I wear the ear pieces properly so that it crosses my neck. This helps the earphone not to fall from back due to wind while driving. I usually wear the earphone with helmet though. - Auto switch off if not in use for quite some time. - Good power usage. Lasts the whole day and 80% charge remains. I charge everyday as a custom. - Microphone has great clarity but don't expect a condenser mic level sound. - Can be used as a hidden mic for speaking in conferences. - Nice placement of buttons for Volume up & down and pause & play. - Nice audio feedback while powering on, connecting, connected, and switching off. - LED blinking light while powering on, connecting, and switching off to know the present status of the headphone. - Easily connected to laptop and other devices i.e. multi device connection and seamless switching between the audio playback from various devices. Preference given to laptop than mobile with mobile phone audio going to pause state.  **Update: 19/12/2019** - Earphone turns off when connecting to both mobile and laptop. [Batter Charge: 80%]. First I connect to mobile, then connect to laptop, then earphone turns off. Previously this was not happening. It used to connect to multiple devices and play through each of them seamlessly depending on the output of the bluetooth audio input. Preference was given to laptop over mobile playback.\",\n",
       " \"I used to use Sony XB55AP. So my review of this Boat earphone is based on relative comparison with sony earphone.  Sound: very good. As good as sony XB55AP. Bass, vocals and treble all are equally good without any overpowered frequency.  Loudness: it's sufficiently loud. My volume for calls is 30, for music in crowded area is 60, Netflix is 30.  Noise cancellation: it's good. But it's too efficient in that as I don't insert the buds fully so I am aware of the surroundings. It depends on bud size and ear shape though.  Bluetooth: good. I connect phone and laptop simultaneously and can switch between zoom on laptops to phone call automatically. Range is normal - can penetrate one wall only. There is Qualcomm aptx hd support but my phone is rooted so I get only AAC option.  Mic : it's good. Blocks background noise and other side can hear me crystal clear.  Comfort: the support hooks are very useful to keep the buds in ear while running or gymming. But cause discomfort after around 60 mins of use. I slid them away so I only use when necessary. Otherwise it's comfortable earphone.  Design: looks classy. I bought teal blue. Black is too aam junta. Magnets are not strong but that's ok. Probably it's weaker to prevent earphone chamber from damaging.  Battery life: that's the best part. My daily usage is 2 hrs calls (phone and laptop combined), 5 hrs video. Daily drain is about only 20%. Can go for a week without charging. Below 20% there is annoying battery low voice notification every 2-5 mins so have to charge it.\",\n",

It's like SIRI/Google Assistant getting active every now and then.  The work would have been done by a beep sound.  I don't use it anymore, I gave it to my sister as I like electronics to be useful not irritating.  The moment you the love the music and start to increase the volume, it will shout : MAXIMUM VOLUME.

I have already tried it in 2 different phones - as HD codec, only AAC is listed. No option for Aptx - other Aptx headphones work fine on the same. Build quality is quite cheap and sound is just okay. If I knew it did not actually support Aptx , I would have definately looked at other options. Also, Amazon does not allow to return it (what is effectiey being sold in fraudalent marketing) which also is not a good experience and just breaks the trust we have had when buying things on Amazon.',\n",

Now I regret my decision to buy this 😠 This is my review after 8 months of usage  I got it for Rs 999/-  The sound quality & bass is ok.  The range is around 10m without any obstacles in the way.  The worst thing is that it doesn't fit into my ear properly. It always keep falling out.👎  I tried the 3 pairs of earbuds provided with the earphone. No use 👎👎  It can't be used while doing exercises or gymming. The neck band kind of jump around with u when you move. Again the earpiece fall out. It might be a design flaw.  Can't even use to make phone calls or recording audio or voice. Same issue👎👎👎  After a while , when you turn your head or when u move or sometimes it comes out of ear by itself.

Have received feedback from friends who were on the other end of call.  Audio: Audio is quite good, bass is alright, the level you can expect at this cost.  Comfort: Comfortable to wear, the earbuds fit perfectly, just the little rubber thing sometimes doesn’t fit in my ears (guess it is meant for bigger ears)  Connectivity: Range is about 5-6ft, not more. Sorry to say this but I have faced this issue with all bluetooth headphones. So I guess either you buy more expensive or stay within this distance of your phone/laptop.

Now I don't know of others taste. While listening music it feels good as it gives balanced output. 2) Among all I'm quite impressed by it's battery life. It really goes on long after continues use I've noticed it & even quickly get charged also once put on charging mode toh anyways battery ka toh muje nhi lagta problem jaldi aane wala h. 3) I've handles it in various ways and also put it in various ways in bags sometimes thrown here and there and main thing I've use it in rain recently for really long time I was riding and suddenly rain came so at that time came to know the quality of it. It's really nice. I've used it in rain for almost 4-5 times in heavy rain although that's different thing that I later on after 10 min covered it because intentionally I don't wanted to damage it. 4) When you are riding a bike and if unfortunately you put earphones in ear which you shouldn't do it but if someone does also then the problem is that by air flow the 👂 earphones get moved away because of air from our body which sometimes make us uncomfortable while riding. So for that you need to tuck earphone's inside your tee or shirt or beneath your collar of shirt to get hold on. 5) It's a very light weight earphones don't go on my words you will feel when you take it in your hands. The only thing they should have provided is more earphone buds of various size they didn't gave anything with box. Overall till now I don't have any hard feelings or negative feelings toward it might be because I haven't I think experienced, that's why. Good to go with this product. 👍\",\n",

       " \"I am using the Rockerz 255 pro earphone for over 2 months now.  After receiving the product, when I first tried pairing it, I was unable to do so as my phone or my laptop was not able to connect to it. I had to manually reset the device (it's simple, look it up online), I was finally able to pair it with both my laptop and my phone.  I have used it to attend numerous meetings and interviews, and never had any problems with it. It has decent noise cancellation.  While it is true that it can connect to both laptop and a smartphone simultaneously, I personally experienced some audio interruptions while listening to music from my laptop, while also connected to a smartphone. I never have any such problems while connected to any one device at a time.  I only have to charge it once a day, for only about 30 mins. It's usually connected to my phone for about 12 hours a day, out of which I actively use it for about 8 hours. I have very recently observed a minor bulge on the left box (the part where the left earpiece is connected to the rest of the neckband), so I think the battery is puffing up a bit (I am not sure about this). The performance has not been affected because of this issue, and only time will tell if this will ever cause any problems.  Initially, I did not like the audio quality of this device. I do not prefer music with a lot of bass, and it feels like this earphone is specifically designed to just amplify bass in any music that is being played. I tried attenuating the bass using the equaliser in my phone, but that worked only to an extent, so I had to download an equaliser app from the playstore to completely attenuate any bass from the music. Doing that, I surprisingly found that the earphone is very much capable of delivering crystal clear audio. As I am not a big fan of bass, I cannot comment on the bass quality of the product, but if anyone working for Boat is reading this review, I would suggest them that while they can design it with hardware that amplifies bass, just do not make that a default feature, as some of us do not enjoy bass.\",\n",

The bass is good for people who are not audiophiles. Like if you're not into sound recording or need minute details to grab onto, its perfect for you. I grabbed the deal in 1k though, so it was a nerve cracking deal for me. The battery lasts for 5 to 6 hrs for me even if I stay connected to the phone via Bluetooth without playing any music. It lacks the backup if I keep using it for listening to music for an hour or so and lasts for about 4.5 hrs or so. Mic quality is kinda okay clear but it catches too much of sounds of around you which can irritate the person on the other line. But on an average a great deal to get your hands on.\",\n",
       " 'This is my third boat Bluetooth headset after boat rockerz 235V2 & 255pro.. I think 235v2 is far more better than 255 series. I will provide its quality as per pros and cons Pros 1. Very good wire quality 2. Noise cancellation good Cons 1 Sound quality not upto the mark.. 235v2 far more better 2. Whenever u receive calls 235v2 starts vibrating which I have not found in 255 series 3. Battery backup not good  Since I have used 235 and 255 series I would say go for 235v2 for better sound quality and experience',\n",

       " \"No doubt about the product. The quality of music and it's bass will never disappoint you. The only thing that is extremely disappointing is it's Bluetooth connectivity, So it comes with Bluetooth 4.2. You can never enjoy music in an open area where it's airy, Cuz that creates hell lot of disturbances while listening to music, I have used Bluetooth 4.2 earphones before this is the worst experience I ever had, The audio stops for more than 3 seconds if it's really windy. And it keeps on interrupting. You can only have a great experience when you're in a room. Plugging in the earphones and riding a bike is your worst decision (first of all it's not safe, 2nd of all, You can't hear a thing of the music or a voice in a call). So I suggest people to go for Bluetooth 5.0 only! If you want seamless experience. I'm not sure boAt has any device that has Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity.\",\n",

Bass is as per other good haedphone and not so so much extra as mentioned here in other reviews and product discription.  Batery is ok for mderate use. Charge every day if use is more then 4- 5 hour in a day  Its very very good for routine listening of music and talk, but if you looking for party type sounds like other big headphone then its not suitable  And so is orice to be kept around 800-1000 thats too also due to brand',\n",

The sound quality is just ok... Not sure of its real or fake coz its just like any other local earphone brand.  You will start feeling headache / ear ache if you are using it for long time.  Also the charger provided with the product is cheap, low quality and the wire is very small in length. The 2 magnets are not quite working..  Only good things about the earphone: Lightweight and good color. The earbuds are fine as they fit in and do not get off easily, in case you go on a running or something while these are on.',\n",
       " \"This bluetooth headset is a nice one. After almost 1.5 years of usage, it is still doing a great job. The box contained the boAt Rockers and three pairs of ear-tips ranging from small to large size.  The battery life is not amazing but it can suffice for a full working day with a lot of calls and streaming internet content. Battery is still in good shape. It shows battery percentage in multiples of 20. For example, after 100%, it will show 80% directly. No issues with that.  The bluetooth range is decent. It tends to disconnect when the device it is connected to is say, a room away. The microphone quality is also decent because no one complained about it.  It is certainly not the absolute best in terms of audio quality. This department is highly subjective but, a pure, neutral sound cannot be expected because of the emphasized bass which I enjoyed. The mid-tones and the high-tones tend to get muffled a little bit but then, that's what we must expect from any earphone that has added bass to it. It is definitely enjoyable.  There exists latency but it's negligible. One might not notice it unless exclusive attention is paid to the same. If you want that added bass and neutral sound isn't your cup of tea, you can check it out! Noise cancellation doesn't make a major difference because the ear-tips are in-ear style. However, it has a micro-USB port that it uses to charge.  However, with the likes of Realme Wireless Buds, OnePlus Z and Oppo Enco in the market, this is not the best buy but it's still a good buy if you're very tight on budget. But 1.5 years ago, it was definitely a great buy. Cheers!\",\n",

       " \"The Boat rockerz are awesome. That are perfect for use while running/jogging. They are comfortable enough that you wouldn’t even feel they're plugged in. Sound is clear and loudness is enough even in crowded areas. Phone calls are good and no irregularities found in voice reception. Battery lasts for over 10 hours even after constant usage. Charging is fast enough. Overall I'm fully satisfied with the rockerz.\",\n",
       " \"So it's been some time I've been using these about a month I guess, and I can say I'm fully content with these, sound quality is good, they are durable, light in weight, fit in ear just there, bass is a bit overrated but I think for me it's ok, voice on call clear enough. So overall a good make all in all, find the below review to check out and decide if these fit your specs for a perfect buy.  So when you unbox these quite a good box and you can see through the plastic covering the headphones, once you open the box you'll find some docs such as the warranty card, and the boat pamphlet, and some other doc's related to boat.  Make - I think the make seems to be quite good in this price, when I wore them for the first time I couldn't feel the headphones around my neck then, they've just managed to make them light but still heavy enough to sustain around your neck, you'll find less buttons and the best part for me is that they have provided a C-type charging socket which was just a Cherry on the cake for me as I possess a One plus. They've taken care that it doesn't get itchy around your neck and also you keep enjoying your music experience so great work on that front, the wires are a bit long coz they are connected to the end of the heavy plastic material, and I'm afraid I might just pop off one the wires if my activities are a bit aggressive, so I hope they work on that part, the erabuds fit okay in the ear I can feel a heaviness in ear when I wear, them, plus the smallest of the rubber tips just seem the medium size to me maybe because of the external part being bigger in size than the internal part that goes in-ear. So I'm not satisfied with the earbud part that goes in-ear but all in all I think they've done a pretty good job to provide the best quality in this price range.  Music and call quality - On the music front I think they've done a decent job, the earphones a loud and packed with extra bass, now what happens is if you are connected and you get a call it just bangs in-ear which could be dangerous if your phone ring volume is full, they are just too loud so it's difficult to guage other music fronts and beats, as far the bass is concerned it's just wow if you're listening to bass packed music. So if you are looking for that detailed music breakdown it's a heartbreak there, and I also happen to get a lag for about .1 or .2 seconds which means gamers I won't recommend these to you, but if you're just looking for casual use I think you can just go for it.  Noise cancellation - Actually people have misunderstood the noise cancellation funda in these, so there is no extra feature or a button where you press and get the Noise cancellation mode active, so then what does it mean, whatever they have advertised that is partly correct yes it has noise cancellation but not that at par, it does a pretty decent job though, if you're wearing these then you might wanna press them into your ear to get better results for the noise cancellation part.  Price - I got these in a sale price of ₹1499 on Amazon, so I feel that's a great buy in such a budget, the original price appears to be ₹1999 however you'll find them at ₹1700 - ₹1800 on Flipkart, do remember to check your prices before you buys these.  All in all a wonderful product if you're engaged in calls, and casual browsing and streaming videos online, good enough for listening to music, I would suggest a best buy budget friendly.\",\n",

The previous rockerz versions had the ability to be used while it was charging, which was something that I really cherished.  Not to mention the annoying \"Maximum volume\" voice when the volume level is at max. It should have been a simple feedback (a small beep would be great) and not the entire sentence which blocks what the end user is trying to say, making the use of this in meetings a bad thing.  Hope boat addresses these issues in the next release.',\n",

I have never used this for listening to music, and hence do not know what is sound quality, when listening to music.

I did not purchase ear buds, as i was afraid of loosing them within a day or two. these being neck bands, they stubbornly hand around my neck, and hence chances of loosing them is very less. audio is interrupted most of the times, and I cant hear the call continuously. but I am not able to verify, whether this is attributed to service provider or neck band. but as of now, I havent got a single breakfree call. each and every call has broken sound. somehow these do not connect with my laptop, however have I tried. that does not go well. fortunetly I have a 3.5mm ear phones, which serve the purpose. but these neckbands do not connect with laptop',\n",

       " \"I'll break down my review into 4 parts : Sound quality, noise cancellation and calls(mic), battery and ergonomics  Sound quality: For the price range of 1.2k, ( I got it for 900 rupees during 2019 Dasara sale ) the quality of sound is pretty crisp. There is a slight overtone to Bass while the other elements are balanced. Personally, I think this balance is perfect. Given the pricing, I'd rate 5/5 for sound quality.  Noise cancellation: For the pricing range, I'd say the noise cancellation is pretty decent. Somewhere close to half volume your noise cancellation works seamlessly while listening to music. On the other hand, when I'm on calls, the noise cancellation is pretty poor. People often tell me that they're clearly able to listen to all the talk and noise and honking etc, from the background but not my voice. So I have to pull the mic closer to my lips to be audible enough to eliminate background noise. So, I'd give 3/5 for noise cancellation.  Battery: I play music at a pretty low volumes (some 3 button presses lower than half volume) So, the battery can easily last upto 6 hrs. If I'm watching a movie or TV series, it'll last for 7-8 hours. The charging time is pretty nominal. I charge it from 6:45 am to 8:15 am and it would have gone from 0 to full charge. You could charge it with a 2.1 A adapter for a much quicker charge but I don't know if the earphones can handle that current without getting damaged in the long run (read the institution manual). So, at this pricing, I'd give battery a 4/5  Ergonomics: I must say, my favourite part is the magnetic lock. It's convenient and you can simply wear it around your neck like a necklace. It's easy to tuck it under your collar and keep it locked when not using. Looks sturdy though I don't wish to test it ! One disadvantage would be that that wire is a little too long and that wasn't necessary. It's bulky and unlike other BT earphones, you can't throw them in a bag, you'll need to be careful where you put it. If the ear hooks are positioned correctly, you should have no pain around the ear cartilage while wearing them for long durations. I wear it 2.5 hrs a day to work and I rarely feel irritated or pain around the ear. So, I'd give ergonomics and overall comfort a 3/5  Combining the ratings for all the above mentioned parameters, the overall eating turns out to be a 4/5 for this pricing which is pretty decent I'd say. Whenever it's on offer (under 1000 bucks) and you want a pair of BT earphones, simply go for it. I can absolutely vouch for it.\",\n",

When i open the box the earphones are only 40% charged and after 5 to 10 minutes i plug tge earphones for charging and after 40 to 50 minutes the neckband are full charged.

Get it on a Prime Day Sale or wait for it to go on a Lightning Deal. 2. Great Noise Cancellation. I have used it in various environment staring from overcrowded bus to setting beside loud sound and the noise cancellation has never failed. It blocks almost 90% of the incoming surrounding noise which is a great plus point. 3. Great battery life. 16+ hours of listening. 4. Quite high volume. 5. Great form factor and the magnets to hold the earphones together is quite strong. 6. Boat provides various ear-cups of different sizes. 7. One tap Google assistant. 8. The wireless range is no doubt great.  Cons: 1. Terrible bass. My 350 INR Boat wired earphones have better bass than this one. 2. Volume could have been a bit higher. 3. Not the greatest sounding earphones. Opt for a wired one if wireless is not a necessity.  Conclusion: If you are on a tight budget and looking for a wireless earphone, then this might be it for you but if you want a great sounding earphone with nice bass, then look for other options. Boat is a company which you can trust. They also have a great customer support. Props for that.',\n",

The person onnthe other end of a call always complain about the irritating noise coming from the earphone, which I cannot hear. To confirm it, I asked my friend to record the call. After listening btobthe recorded call, I could hear some sound like tak-tak-tak. My colleague does not have this issue though. I cannot use it for a longer period of time since my ears start having pain.  Otherwise, it a good earphone. Good to buy at this rate.',\n",
       " 'I really rely a lot on reviews while buying stuffs. So I take efforts in writing one to help others too. Well, I was actually blowed out by the near to lakh positive reviews of this headphone. So ordered it without 2nd thot, faced two issues, 1. Bluetooth range wasnt satisfactory and 2. Constant disturbance. I assumed that may be mine is defective as I still relied on reviews I had read. So I ordered a replacement. Sadly the replacement looked like a refurbished item with no proper seal and packing. Anyways it was the same as I felt on my 1st boat. Additinally, I ordered sony WIC200 headphones. The experience was different. Advantage was good range of connectivity and soft sound on ears. So to summarise, in a line for people who like bass, mostly want to use it for movies or hear music, BOAT is best in range and for people who want good call range and soft sound for music n movies may like to buy WIC200 Sony.',\n",

       " 'I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250. The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250. I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz. Everyone should give them a try once. I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.',\n",

At cost difference of Rs. 1200 of boat and Rs. 1600 for OnePlus, boat rockerz 255 pro+ were truly value for money! Just keep in mind that OnePlus has a little better sound latency and hence kinda better for gaming. However I will not recommended any wireless earphones under Rs.2000 which is good for gaming.',\n",

       " \"I have the wireless on the ear headphones from BOAT (400 I guess...can't remember the model details) for about 2 years and still works well. I am an occasional user of that.  But I wanted something for my commute and I was looking for something wireless and with in ear buds to go with my 1+6T. I found these for 1k during the recent sale. Here are my initial impressions  1. The sound signature is very very bassy. You need to use an EQ to bring it to your liking. Try listening to a song that has a heavy beat or bass played high to experience your tolerance levels. 2. If you use a One Plus 6 or newer phone, go into the audio tuner option in settings and set the 'Sound Enhancement' option to 'One Plus Bullets Wireless's and the EQ preset to 'Pop'. This should balance out the bass and it surprisingly alleviated the mid tones. 3. Pairing was east. Long press the middle button and put your phone on blue tooth discovery mode. 5. Sweat resistance and durability is something I have to wait and watch as this is just initial days. But looking at the construction quality, I think it should be ok. 6. Call Quality - not checked. But I don't intend to use it to take too many calls anyway.  Verdict: Good for 1k but not worth more. in fact paying more than 1k and buying something for listening music falls into the audiophile category. For that, you should really invest in an established brand like Bose or Sennheiser.\",\n",
       " '1. design is good or say just okay. 2. Plastic body. 3. Battery backup is great. 4. Bass is too much, should be little lower. 5. Connectivity is okay with iPhone mostly connect automatically on power on. 5. Call quality : okay not good bt in price which is Amazon offering it is good. Where no noise, call quality is good. Out side, too much wind sound reach to other. Still to check in crowded area perhaps not build for. 6. Bluetooth range is good.  Conclusion: below 2000/- anyone should not expect good call quality. Rest is good. U can choose this wireless earphone 255 plus pro without hesitation.',\n",

       " \"It is a nice product. I use mainly for calls and watching videos. My friends told me the call clarity is better than One plus bullets. Pairing is easy.I think an average person uses his phone for 6 hours only per day, so just have to charge it everyday like we charge our mobiles. It gives proper 6 hours play back, range is as listed. Inconvenience is only that the magnetic function on the earbuds doesn't switch off and on the device as in oneplus. But if you wanna go for earphone under a budget price, I really recommend this. Tip: buy while the product is on discount, we got it for Rs.899.\",\n",

Pros: Sound is crispy and clear Material and design Price Con: Bass is not so high, but it is enough!!!  Love the co. This is my third earphone from boat and I have never disappointed. Whoever want a budget earphone, just go for it.\",\n",
       " \"They're best at this price point , before buying them i did my research and i was right , it's amazing , the only thing i didn't like is the right side piece fall out of my ear alot whenever i try to use the control buttons , maybe my ear is built different , but from sound perspective , they're really great , bass is also really good , clarity was on point as well . The best selling point for them is the battery , no other product is offering 40hrs battery.\",\n",
       " 'This product is good, but not worth the price. I found three issues:- 1- bass quality is poor (poor than the boat 225 I used, and regardless of its description saying \"extra bass\" 2- hissing sound on connecting. 3- no proper volume boundaries. When it is on vol. 1,2,3, the sound is very low, and increases suddenly when taken to vol 4. On achieving minimum volume, the earphones tell \"minimum volume\" with a volume which is full I guess. Lol.  Overall, I hated this product, and have issued it for return.',\n",
       " 'I already had boat rockerz 400 which has good battery backup upto 9 to 10 hours so i brought this for 1299 in an offer. Talking about pros 1. It has great design with metal body feels premium. 2. If you listen music equalizer than believe me it has some really good bass. 3. It has a great connection with i think above 10m which is again great. 4. Battery charging is really fast i mean this charges the earphone from 0 to 100 in just 45 mins. 5. Sound quality is good i can hear all the instrumental sound clearly.  Cons. 1. Battery backup is very low at 70% volume it will run for only 5 to 6 hours so to get more battery you need to lower the volume which is not good. 2. Without equalizer the vocals and mids are good but bass is very low.  The only reason i am returning it is battery backup otherwise this may be the best wireless neckband under 1500. If battery backup ia not an issue for you then you should definitely buy it this is best. It only lost my 1 star bcuz of battery otherwise it deserves 5 star.',\n",

Bought this product 8-9 months ago. 1) Now It has started to automatically disconnect and the left one isn't working. 2) First of all Amazon doesn't take care of the warranty. 3) You have to directly contact boat support. 4) I contacted their customer care they didn't pick up. 5) they messaged me an address of their service center near me. I went their and they refused the warranty. 6) this bluetooth earphone has a charging port which has a rubber lid which is about 2-3mm it is connected to the earphone through a very delicate rubber piece. It is so delicate that it doesn't matter how much you take care of it, it will eventually tear off and get lost. Now that 2-3 mm price of rubber has no technical purpose not one. But it has sabotaged my warranty. 7) I cannot claim my warranty because of that 1mm piece of rubber 8) This is a LOOPHOLE delebrately made by BIAT so that customers cannot claim the WARRANTY. 9) I bought this for 1499/- and cannot claim the warranty because of their clever loophole.\",\n",

I am using it for my Cell and while watching movies/programs on my Smart TV. I was unable to connect to my laptop due to Bluetooth issues on my laptop. I may have to use dangle on my laptop.  Likes - 1. Its easy to pair your devices with this earphone. 2. Sound quality is good. 3. Noise cancellation is good. 4. Light weight and stylish to use anywhere. 5. It is water resistant (Not water proof, remember). One time, I have used it in the moderate rain as well. 6. Easy to carry and not bulky. Provided magnet keeps both earbuds at one place, so it won't be a discomfort when you are walking/running/in Gym and not using the earphones. 7. Decent battery backup. I use 2 hours at a time mostly. In a day, I use it for like 3 to 4 hours and I only charge once in 2 days based on my usage. If you use more than that, then you may have to charge it everyday. Dislikes - 1. As they advertised, I am unable to pair two devices simultaneously. 2. Its an irritation to charge as the battery pin will not fit with adapter at one go. You have to carefully insert it. 3. Unable to answer the call via ear phones. You have to answer it on the cell phone and talk via earphones. Same goes for cutting the call. 4. Initially, there was discomfort to keep the earphone in the ear for an hour itself (while walking). After that, Its ok.  My conclusion - Good one to buy.\",\n",
       " \"BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro+ , I think it's a brilliant neckband/wireless earphone from BoAt in battery life.. I received it on 30 may 10:45 Am (with 100% Charge) i using it from after 12:30 PM , and I reviewing it on 5 june, after using 6 days in normal way (6/7 hour daily), it says battery low on 5 june around 9/10Am , then i plugged in charging for 10 minutes , then it shows 60%, then i think it can provide upto 10 hour or 7/8 hour call/music playback in 10 minutes charge, and it takes 1 hour for full charge..  Comment by features :  * Look : Look is not a premium look, in comparison to others neckband. (335, 330 etc.)  * Noise cancellation : Noise Cancellation is good but not excellent.  * Sound Quality : Sound is good and bass is excellent with AAC codec, but my phone (Samsung Galaxy J7 ) doesn't support aptX codec then i can't tell anything about aptX codec..  I'm a bass lover 😍  * Battery : battery is awesome , it's provide me 6 days after using it 6/7 hour daily (charge from manufacturer/marketing agency or packer)  But you can assume as it can provide 36 to 38 hour battery backup..  * Sticker : I puted the sticker on earphone left handle and it's improve the look of the earphone.. And i suggesting to BoAt that print this as a plastic print on any handle of earphone..  * Dual pairing : Dual pairing is good but not excellent.  *** Tips/Suggestions From me : Turn on Hall and surround music effects & balance the bass/treble and Instrumental/Vocal from your phone for better sound quality as per mentioned screenshot.  After turning on these effects, you will feel that you are in heaven of music world..  After using these effects you can't feel irritation in long period of listening music, it provides you soft music..  Note : I'm using it, and i can modify the review as per performance..\",\n",
       " 'I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too. Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it. I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)  But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.

After a few months, I started facing connectivity issues. I had to reconnect them to my phone every few minutes. Overall, I'm not happy with these earphones.

I paid Rs.1490/-, while in 5 days price was Rs.1049/- and now again it Rs.1499, so watchout for price before buying. 2. Battery indication on your mobile for this device, shows 100 to 80 then directly to 0 sometimes, or 100 to 80 to 60 to 0. 3. Charging time is clearly 1hr 40min. Which is 1hr in 255 Pro.

However the main and probably the selling point of this Bluetooth neckband is, it promises 40 hrs of continuous backup, at mid volume when fully charged.

So, a relief there and it has dual pairing option too (which was also missing in my previous TWS earbuds). It definitely is a great buy at this price and have purchased a total of 3 for my family members and myself and recommended to one of my friends as well; she too likes and loves it 😜 and not to forget about the after sale service boat offers; it's incredible.

       " 'The best Bluetooth headphones I have ever used. The Best in this price category.  Pros: 1. Unbelievable battery backup. I am getting 1 day battery stand by. I use in office from 9 am to 7 pm then the battery lasts throgh out the night. 2. Best fit. The earpieces will not fall out how hard you shake your head. 3. Light weight. It is so light weight you can not feel the band on your neck. 4. Stylish look. 5. Magnetic parts on the earpieces make them stick together.  Cons: 1. Sometimes you feel like the wire is lengthy. 2. There is a voice notification when calls come \"incoming call\". It would have been superb if the voice notification says the contacts names.',\n",
       " 'I had ordered it because I had expected more from it. This is my second Bluetooth inear headphone (first was the old LG HBS 730, mind-blowing device). Anyways, the sound is OK - not bad but not good. Noise cancellation is good, voice call audio quality is clear to the other end, the buttons are good but can be more tactile.  My only gripe is that the music audio quality can be better. Bass should be more powerful and the mids, treble should be a bit more clear and refined.  Also, I suggest that they should add the two volume buttons + call connect/disconnect button at the left side + a vibration motor and keep the right side only for multimedia buttons (play/pause/rewind/next/previous).  But, since the price was much less in Amazon sale (below 800), it is only fair for the quality we get. I will hope they fix all this and release their next version, even the price is higher.',\n",
       " \"The product has a waranty of 1 year (My purchase is in July 2019, now May 2020). My one side earphone is not working now after use of 8 months. I use this mostly for office calls and movie watching. Seems to me not long lasting product. Now I'm residing in Bangalore where Govt marked as Corona red zone, and want to raise a complaint on warrenty. But what i hear is that, we must visit service center for warrenty claims. I'm OK with this but why not register complaint online and then visit center? If the lockdown continued more and i might miss warrenty period to claim the same. Please first take the complaint online and that means the defective product is highlighted and we can then visit the store later for replacement or repair. I'm writing this as a proof of defective product that i have. Also i spoke to service center (DVG road Bangalore - 09886114663) and recorded the call for future reference.\",\n",
       " \"+ Really pathetic customer service. Called thousands of time at their fort store but no one answers. Even if some one answers they don't service properly. Received call from some pratik guy he said he will ask someone to call but it's been more than 3 to 4 weeks no update. AVOID BOAT.. VERY VERY BAD BRAND AND AFTER SALES SERVICE..  + The ear grips get too loose. I have already lost one, ther is no support from BOAT customer service team. The performance is not upto the mark. Doesn't work when the phone is kept in the pocket. Range of bluetooth breaks after couple of meters.  Total waste of money.\",\n",

I am waiting since over 2 months, they do not reply to mails, customer service calls also not fruitful, they just read out status. Very bad experience. On their website, they write #1 service, laughable. Pl get it repaired locally, the product is not worth the wait to get repaired from such worst service center who don't even care to reply. Checkout internet for such customer harassment where many others are suffering. Super pathetic service.\",\n",
       " 'Boat produces best quality products & I appreciate their warranty policy. Just before 10 days of warranty expiry I found one of the ear pieces is not working & I asked for replacement they accepted for repair/replacement. They find fault with the earpiece & they sent me a new one as a replacement.I am very happy with your customer relationship.I will definitely recommend boat to everyone & also I want to purchase ur new airdopes.',\n",
       " 'I have bought it 4-5 days ago and i am not happy with this. there are few point noticeable . 1) Audio Quality - is Good but not very nice as it have over Bass. so you cant feel the song. you need to adjust the levels. 2) Fitting - cause it is light and not flexible this wont stay at your neck. i can drop very easily if you are riding bike or running. also the earbud are very big in size. 3) Charging/Battery - i did charged it more then one time for now as its new so i am not sure how long it is gonna work. but i feel that the charging port is only working with its cable only (as it has universal charging port so it should charge with any mobile charger also)  overall good but expensive according to its quality.',\n",
